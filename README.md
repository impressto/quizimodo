## üìä Setting Up Score Tracking API

Quizimodo supports optional score tracking to allow users to compare their performance with others. You can implement the backend API using PHP, Node.js, or Python (or whatever works for you).

### Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com/api  # Base URL for your API endpoints
```

### Backend Implementation Options

Example implementations for different backend technologies are provided in the `public/api_examples` directory:

#### PHP Implementation

1. Create a directory for storing scores:

```bash
mkdir -p public/api/scores
chmod 755 public/api/scores
```

2. Copy the example PHP files from `public/api_examples` to your server:
   - `save-score.php` - Handles saving quiz scores
   - `quiz-stats.php` - Provides quiz statistics

See the [save-score.php](public/api_examples/save-score.php) and [quiz-stats.php](public/api_examples/quiz-stats.php) files for complete implementations.

#### Node.js Implementation

1. Set up a Node.js server using Express:

```bash
mkdir -p api
cd api
npm init -y
npm install express cors body-parser fs-extra
```

2. Copy the [server.js](public/api_examples/server.js) example from `public/api_examples` to your server.

3. Run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

#### Python Implementation (with Flask)

1. Set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask flask-cors
```

2. Copy the [app.py](public/api_examples/app.py) example from `public/api_examples` to your server.

3. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Frontend Integration

The quiz application already includes built-in support for score tracking. The main components that handle this functionality are:

1. `src/scoreService.ts` - Contains functions for saving scores and fetching statistics
2. `src/QuizResult.tsx` - Displays the quiz results and statistics

To enable or disable score tracking, simply set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api  # For local development with API in /public/api
# or
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com/api  # For production
```

## üìã Quiz JSON Format

Quizimodo uses a straightforward JSON format for defining quizzes. Each quiz is defined in its own JSON file in the `public/quizzes/[topic]` directory.

### Basic Quiz Structure

```json
{
  "title": "Quiz Title",
  "description": "Short description of the quiz content",
  "time": "15 minutes",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the question?",
      "options": [
        "Option A",
        "Option B",
        "Option C",
        "Option D"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Explanation of why Option C is correct"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Quiz Features

#### Code Examples

You can include code examples in questions, options, and explanations using HTML with special styling classes:

```json
{
  "question": "What will this code output?",
  "example": "<div class='quiz-code-dark'><pre><span class='keyword'>function</span> <span class='function'>example</span>() {\n  <span class='function'>console</span>.<span class='function'>log</span>(<span class='string'>'Hello World'</span>);\n}</pre></div>",
  "options": [
    "It will print 'Hello World'",
    "It will return 'Hello World'",
    "Nothing, the function is never called",
    "It will throw an error"
  ]
}
```

The `example` field can be used to display code or other formatted content between the question text and the answer options. This is especially useful for coding quizzes where you want to show a code sample for the user to analyze.

#### Code Styling Classes

The following classes are available for styling code:

- `quiz-code` - Light background code block
- `quiz-code-dark` - Dark background code block (preferred)
- `keyword` - For language keywords
- `string` - For string literals
- `function` - For function names
- `comment` - For comments
- `number` - For numeric literals
- `jsx-tag`, `jsx-attribute`, `jsx-expression` - For JSX syntax

#### Inline Code in Options

You can wrap text in backticks (`) to display it as inline code, which is especially useful for HTML tags or code snippets in answer options:

```json
"options": [
  "Regular text option",
  "`<div>Some HTML Code</div>`",
  "Another text option",
  "`const x = 42;`"
]
```

#### Additional Explanation

For more complex topics, you can include a detailed explanation with example code that will be shown after the user selects an answer:

```json
{
  "explanation": "The correct answer is Option B because...",
  "exampleExplanation": "<div class='quiz-code-dark'><pre><span class='comment'>// Here's the correct implementation</span>\n<span class='keyword'>function</span> <span class='function'>betterExample</span>() {\n  <span class='keyword'>return</span> <span class='string'>'Hello World'</span>;\n}</pre></div>"
}
```

The `exampleExplanation` field is used to show example code or other formatted content after the main explanation, often to demonstrate the correct approach.

### HTML Support

All text fields (question, options, explanation) support HTML, allowing you to include:

- Formatting (`<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Links (`<a>`)
- And other HTML elements

For security reasons, always ensure that any HTML content is properly sanitized in a production environment.

## üåê Deploying to a Web Server

To deploy Quizimodo to a web server, follow these steps:

1. Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server.

3. Configure your web server to serve the `index.html` file for any routes that don't match a physical file.

### Example Apache Configuration (.htaccess)

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Embedding in an Existing Website

You can also embed Quizimodo into an existing website:

1. Build the application.
2. Copy the contents of the `dist` folder to a subdirectory of your website.
3. Use an iframe to embed the quiz:

```html
<iframe 
  src="path/to/quizimodo/index.html" 
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: none;"
  title="Quiz Application"
></iframe>
```

### Loading Specific Topics and Quizzes

You can specify a particular topic and even a specific quiz to load directly when the application starts:

#### Method 1: Using HTML Data Attributes

Add data attributes to the root element:

```html
<!-- Load a specific topic -->
<div id="root" data-topic="react"></div>

<!-- Load a specific topic AND a specific quiz -->
<div id="root" data-topic="react" data-quiz="react-coding-quiz"></div>
```

#### Method 2: Using URL Hash

Add a hash to the URL to specify the quiz:

```
https://example.com/quizzes/#react-coding-quiz
```

This can be combined with the data-topic attribute to load quizzes from different topics.

#### Method 3: Using Query Parameters in an iframe

When embedding the quiz in an iframe, you can include the quiz ID in the URL:

```html
<iframe 
  src="path/to/quizimodo/index.html#react-coding-quiz" 
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: none;"
  title="React Coding Quiz"
></iframe>
```

The application will:
1. First check for a hash in the URL
2. Then check for a quiz specified via data-quiz attribute
3. Fall back to showing the quiz selection screen if neither is provided
