    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the correct way to declare a variable in Python?",
      "options": [
        "var x = 5",
        "x = 5",
        "let x = 5",
        "int x = 5"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, you declare a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign (=). No keywords like 'var' or 'let' are needed. For example: `x = 5` creates a variable named x with the value 5."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a valid Python data type?",
      "options": [
        "list",
        "dictionary",
        "array",
        "tuple"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "'array' is not a built-in Python data type. Python has lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets as its main built-in collection types. While arrays can be used in Python through the array module or libraries like NumPy, they are not a fundamental built-in type like the others."
