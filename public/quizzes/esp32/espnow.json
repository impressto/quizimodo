        "High power consumption",
        "Limited to short-range communication only",
        "Requires an internet connection"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "A potential disadvantage of using ESP-NOW is that it has no built-in packet retransmission or delivery guarantees. Since ESP-NOW is a connectionless protocol, it doesn't have mechanisms like TCP to ensure packets are delivered or to automatically retransmit lost packets. Applications that require reliable communication must implement their own acknowledgment and retransmission logic."
