  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the correct way to declare a variable in Python?",
      "options": [
        "var x = 5",
        "x = 5",
        "let x = 5",
        "int x = 5"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, you declare a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign (=). No keywords like 'var' or 'let' are needed. For example: `x = 5` creates a variable named x with the value 5."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a valid Python data type?",
      "options": [
        "list",
        "dictionary",
        "array",
        "tuple"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "'array' is not a built-in Python data type. Python has lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets as its main built-in collection types. While arrays can be used in Python through the array module or libraries like NumPy, they are not a fundamental built-in type like the others."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the output of `print(type([]))` in Python?",
      "options": [
        "<class 'list'>",
        "<class 'array'>",
        "<type 'list'>",
        "<class 'tuple'>"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The output of `print(type([]))` is `<class 'list'>`. In Python, empty square brackets `[]` create an empty list, and the `type()` function returns the class/type of the object."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "How do you create a function in Python?",
      "options": [
        "function myFunc():",
        "def myFunc():",
        "create myFunc():",
        "func myFunc():"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, you create a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. For example: `def myFunc():`. This syntax defines a new function that can be called later in your code."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of these is the correct way to create a list in Python?",
      "options": [
        "list = (1, 2, 3)",
        "list = [1, 2, 3]",
        "list = {1, 2, 3}",
        "list = {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct way to create a list in Python is using square brackets: `[1, 2, 3]`. Parentheses `()` create tuples, curly braces `{}` create sets or dictionaries (when using key-value pairs), but square brackets `[]` are used for lists."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What does the `range(5)` function return in Python?",
      "options": [
        "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]",
        "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",
        "A range object that generates numbers from 0 to 4",
        "A range object that generates numbers from 1 to 5"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "`range(5)` returns a range object that generates numbers from 0 to 4 (inclusive of 0, exclusive of 5). Range objects are iterable and generate numbers on demand rather than creating a list in memory. To get an actual list, you would use `list(range(5))`."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "How do you import a module in Python?",
      "options": [
        "include module_name",
        "import module_name",
        "require module_name",
        "use module_name"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, you import a module using the `import` keyword followed by the module name. For example: `import math`. This makes all the functions and variables from that module available in your code."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the correct way to open a file in Python for reading?",
      "options": [
        "open('file.txt', 'r')",
        "file = read('file.txt')",
        "open('file.txt', 'read')",
        "file = open('file.txt', read)"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct way to open a file for reading in Python is `open('file.txt', 'r')`. The `open()` function takes two arguments: the file name and the mode. 'r' stands for read mode. This returns a file object that you can use to read the file's contents."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a valid Python loop?",
      "options": [
        "for loop",
        "while loop",
        "do-while loop",
        "nested loop"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Python does not have a built-in do-while loop like some other languages. Python has for loops and while loops as its primary looping constructs. Nested loops are just loops inside other loops, which are valid in Python."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the output of `print(5 // 2)` in Python?",
      "options": [
        "2.5",
        "2",
        "2.0",
        "3"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The output of `print(5 // 2)` is `2`. The double forward slash `//` is the floor division operator in Python, which divides two numbers and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result (rounding down)."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "How do you handle exceptions in Python?",
      "options": [
        "try/catch",
        "try/except",
        "catch/exception",
        "handle/error"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, exceptions are handled using the `try/except` block. The code that might raise an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the code to handle the exception is placed in the `except` block. This is different from some other languages that use `try/catch`."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement in Python?",
      "options": [
        "To define the main function of the program",
        "To check if the script is being run directly or being imported as a module",
        "To declare the entry point of a class",
        "To import the main module"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement checks if the script is being run directly or being imported as a module. When a Python file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`. When it's imported as a module, `__name__` is set to the module's name. This allows you to write code that only runs when the file is executed directly, not when it's imported."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which of these is the correct way to create a dictionary in Python?",
      "options": [
        "dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}",
        "dict = [1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c']",
        "dict = (1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c')",
        "dict = {1, 2, 3: 'a', 'b', 'c'}"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct way to create a dictionary in Python is using curly braces with key-value pairs separated by colons: `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}`. Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs where each key must be unique."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What does the `pass` statement do in Python?",
      "options": [
        "It skips the current iteration of a loop",
        "It's a null operation - nothing happens when it's executed",
        "It passes control to the next function",
        "It exits the current function"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The `pass` statement is a null operation in Python - nothing happens when it's executed. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required, but you don't want any code to execute. For example, you might use it in an empty function or class definition, or in an empty loop or conditional block."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "How do you create a class in Python?",
      "options": [
        "class MyClass:",
        "def MyClass():",
        "create MyClass:",
        "new MyClass:"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Python, you create a class using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. For example: `class MyClass:`. This defines a new class that can have methods and attributes."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is the output of `print('Hello' + 'World')` in Python?",
      "options": [
        "HelloWorld",
        "Hello World",
        "'Hello' + 'World'",
        "Error"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The output of `print('Hello' + 'World')` is `HelloWorld`. The `+` operator concatenates strings in Python without adding any spaces. If you wanted a space between the words, you would need to include it explicitly: `'Hello ' + 'World'`."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a valid way to comment in Python?",
      "options": [
        "# This is a comment",
        "/* This is a comment */",
        "''' This is a multi-line comment '''",
        "''' This is also a multi-line comment '''"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "`/* This is a comment */` is NOT a valid way to comment in Python. Python only has single-line comments using the `#` symbol and multi-line strings (using triple quotes) that are often used as comments. The `/* */` syntax is used in languages like C, C++, and Java, but not in Python."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `self` parameter in Python class methods?",
      "options": [
        "It refers to the class itself",
        "It refers to the instance of the class",
        "It's a reserved keyword for static methods",
        "It's used to define private methods"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The `self` parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class. It's a convention (not a keyword) that is used as the first parameter in instance methods to access the instance's attributes and methods. When a method is called on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Which of these is the correct way to install a package using pip?",
      "options": [
        "pip get package_name",
        "pip install package_name",
        "pip download package_name",
        "pip add package_name"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The correct way to install a package using pip is `pip install package_name`. Pip is the package installer for Python, and the `install` command is used to add new packages to your Python environment."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What is a lambda function in Python?",
      "options": [
        "A function defined with the `lambda` keyword that can have any number of arguments but only one expression",
        "A special type of loop",
        "A function that can only be called once",
        "A function that automatically returns None"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions are often used for short, simple functions that are needed temporarily. Example: `lambda x, y: x + y`."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "What does the `*args` parameter in a function definition mean?",
      "options": [
        "It allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments as a tuple",
        "It specifies that all arguments must be keyword arguments",
        "It indicates that the function accepts no arguments",
        "It's used to define default argument values"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The `*args` parameter in a function definition allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments, which are then accessible as a tuple within the function. This is useful when you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to your function."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What does the `**kwargs` parameter in a function definition mean?",
      "options": [
        "It allows the function to accept any number of keyword arguments as a dictionary",
        "It specifies that all arguments must be positional arguments",
        "It indicates that the function accepts exactly two arguments",
        "It's used to define required arguments"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The `**kwargs` parameter in a function definition allows the function to accept any number of keyword arguments, which are then accessible as a dictionary within the function. The name `kwargs` is a convention (short for 'keyword arguments'), but you can use any name preceded by `**`."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a built-in Python function?",
      "options": [
        "print()",
        "len()",
        "scan()",
        "range()"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "`scan()` is NOT a built-in Python function. `print()`, `len()`, and `range()` are all built-in functions in Python. `scan()` might be a function in some other languages or libraries, but it's not part of Python's standard library."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "What is the purpose of list comprehensions in Python?",
      "options": [
        "To create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable",
        "To sort lists in ascending order",
        "To remove duplicate items from a list",
        "To concatenate multiple lists"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "List comprehensions in Python are used to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list, tuple, or string). They provide a concise way to create lists and are often more readable than using traditional for-loops. Example: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]` creates a list of squares of numbers from 0 to 9."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "What is the difference between `==` and `is` in Python?",
      "options": [
        "`==` checks for value equality, `is` checks for identity (same object in memory)",
        "`==` is for numbers, `is` is for strings",
        "`==` is case-sensitive, `is` is not",
        "There is no difference, they are interchangeable"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Python, `==` checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value), while `is` checks for identity (whether two references point to the same object in memory). For example, `a == b` checks if a and b have the same value, while `a is b` checks if a and b are actually the same object. This distinction is important when dealing with mutable objects and when comparing small integers or strings that might be interned by Python."
